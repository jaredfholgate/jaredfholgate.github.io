### The Problem

Have you ever needed to create a .npmrc file or another file or folder that starts with a dot and hit an issue when you tried it in Windows Explorer?

If you've tried it, you will see this infuriating error in Windows Exlporer `You must type a file name.`;

![You must type a file name.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yr7sipmxxz1fowy/FileDotError.png?raw=1 \"You must type a file name.\")

You've probably given up at that point and resorted to doing it through the command line.


### The Solution

Well there's an easy way round it, add a dot at the end, so `.npmrc` becomes `.npmrc.`. Windows Explorer then automatically removes the dot at the end and you are good to go.
